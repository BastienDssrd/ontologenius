Ontologenius is a project that aims to read ontologies and link them together to allow you to interoperate them.

```
- Okay, your project is nice but there is already a standardization in this area
  and there is a lot of language that can interoperate with ontologies ...
- Yes I know but my project is different! I will explain to you ...
```

With this project, I want to relax the standardization of ontologies to keep only the most necessary information.

```
- Do you really want to relax standardization ?!
- Do not worry, there are only a few changes.
```
With these changes and with a local and more powerful reasoner, the ultimate goal is to query ontologies in minimal time and only with information about you.
