# ontologenius architecture

In the source and include folder, you will find several folders each containing part of the project. This architecture file is intended to make you understand the overall architecture of the project by presenting the various sub-architecture.

## ontoGraphs

**ontoGraphs** aims to contain all ontology words (individuals, classes and properties) and to provide quick access to each data and the relationships between all data. In addition, it can analyze the validity of the global ontology and read the OWL files to fill the ontology data structure.
